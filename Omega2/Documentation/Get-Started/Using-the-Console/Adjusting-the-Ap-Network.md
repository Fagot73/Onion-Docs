## Adjusting the Omega's WiFi AP Network {#adjusting-omega-ap-network-using-console}

<!-- deprecated -->
```{r child = './Deprecated-component.md'}
```

The `Wi-Fi AP Settings` tab in the Settings app is used to configure your Omega's Access Point WiFi network.

On this page you can change your Omega's:

* SSID
* password
* encryption type
* IP address. 

You can also enable or disable the access point with the checkbox located at the top.

| Enable AP Mode | Enables the Omega's Access Point when checked|
| AP Network (SSID) | The Omega's Access Point SSID |
| Security | The encryption type for the Omega's Access Point |
| AP Password | The password for accessing the Omega's Access Point |
| IP Address | The Omega's IP Address on the Access Point |
