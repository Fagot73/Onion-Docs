## Using the Ethernet Expansion {#using-ethernet-expansion}


The Ethernet Expansion is a piece of hardware that adds a standard RJ45 ethernet port to your Omega, allowing for quick and easy Ethernet connections with other devices. With this Expansion, you can easily use your Omega as a router, an Ethernet bridge, and more.

>You can learn more about the technical specifications of the Ethernet Expansion in our [Ethernet Expansion hardware overview](#ethernet-expansion)

### Learn More about the Omega's Ethernet Port

See the [documentation article](#the-ethernet-port) on the Omega's ethernet port and its modes of operation to learn more. 

### Going Further with the Ethernet Expansion

If you don't have a router and need to supply a wireless network and internet connectivity to devices, the Ethernet Expansion can transform the Omega into a very effective router. For more on that you can read our [tutorial on transforming your Omega into a router](#omega-router)


You can use the Ethernet Expansion and the Omega to provide a wired connection to a laptop or a computer. This is known as an Ethernet Bridge, and you can learn more about it in our [tutorial on creating an Ethernet Bridge using the Omega](#ethernet-bridge)
