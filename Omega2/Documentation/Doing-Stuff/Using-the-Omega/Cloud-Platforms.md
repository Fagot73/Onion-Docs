## Connecting to Cloud Platforms


In this section we would like to present you our supported Cloud Platforms. So far, we are connected with Amazon Web Services, Losant, Ubidots, IBM Watson IoT and Blynk. Please continue reading to find out further details and instructions on how to get started and proceed to a project making!

### Amazon Web Services

AWS is an IoT cloud platform that allows connected devices interact with cloud applications and other devices. To read more about the abilities that AWS has, please look at their [official documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/). We've also made several tutorials on how to get your Omega up and running with Amazon Cloud Services. These tutorials include:

* [Single Command AWS IoT Setup](https://onion.io/2bt-aws-iot-setup-single-command/)
* [Pushing Sensor Data to Sensor Data to AWS IoT](https://onion.io/2bt-aws-iot-pushing-sensor-data/)
* [Visualizing Sensor Data on AWS](https://onion.io/2bt-aws-iot-visualizing-sensor-data/)


### Losant

Losant is a very powerful IoT Cloud Platform. Itâ€™s a great fit for making your Omega projects flexible, customizable and cloud-connected!
Here is the link to their website where you can look up Omega2 and get started with Losant: https://www.losant.com/blog/getting-started-with-omega2-and-losant
We have created a Smart Plant project that involves sending datapoints to Losant and receiveing commands. Please refer to the part 2 of this project that covers in depth details on how to set up an account with Losant, create an application and send data points, [here it is](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/smart-plant-p2.html)
Once you've got familiar with their interface and get that Losant flavor, you may want to go further. Here is the link for our part 4 of this project that allows you to automate your watering system while you are out nad want to make sure your plant watered enough: https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/smart-plant-p4.html


### Ubidots

Ubidots allows you to monitor sensor data, process it and turn it into user-friendly information. Use your Omega to automate your Cloud-Connected interface! First thing to get you an idea of what ubidots can do is to [create an account](https://app.ubidots.com/accounts/signup/) and add your Omega device.
Once you have signed up, you may want to see how it operates by following instructions from our [Project Book](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/ubidots-temperature-monitor.html)


### IBM Watson IoT

Now, that you have an idea what the Cloud Platform is, you may find out that there is a lot more platforms available. The powerful [IBM Watson IoT](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/connect-an-onion-omega2-to-ibm-watson-iot-platform/) allows you to fully automate your cloud-connected devices  and integrate them into a interconnected platform. We have also worked with their invention and created our own [Weather Station](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-project-book-vol1/weather-station.html) IoT based project. 


### Blynk

With Blynk, you may control your IoT device, in this case Omega2, with your smartphone! For Omega2, there is a [Blynk library](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/blynk-library.html) that is available that comes as a NodeJS module and can be installed using OPKG. For more information you can visit [Official BLynk Website](https://www.blynk.io/business/) that will help you get started
